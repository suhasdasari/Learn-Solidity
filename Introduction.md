**What is Solidity?**
* Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level programming language designed specifically for writing smart contracts on blockchain platforms, particularly Ethereum.
* It was created by the Ethereum Network team to construct and design smart contracts on blockchain platforms.
* Solidity is statically typed and supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types.
* It is influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript, making it relatively easy to learn for developers familiar with these languages.

**Key Features of Solidity**
* Contract-oriented: Smart contracts are the core building blocks in Solidity.
* Runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
* Statically typed language.
* Supports inheritance, libraries, and user-defined types2.

**Four High Level Constructs**
1. pragma
2. import

**Contract consists:**
1. State variables
2. Structure definitions
3. Modifier definitions
4. Event declarations
5. Enumeration definitions
6. Function definitions
