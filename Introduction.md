What is Solidity?**
Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level programming language designed specifically for writing smart contracts on blockchain platforms, particularly Ethereum12. Key points about Solidity include:
It was created by the Ethereum Network team to construct and design smart contracts on blockchain platforms1.
Solidity is statically typed and supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types2.
It is influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript, making it relatively easy to learn for developers familiar with these languages2.

Key Features of Solidity**
Contract-oriented: Smart contracts are the core building blocks in Solidity.
Runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)1.
Statically typed language.
Supports inheritance, libraries, and user-defined types2.
